# Tableau-sales_dashboard
The dashboard revolves on the data about the sales of a fictional retailing company operating all over the US: SuperStore.

**Assumption:** I work as a Data Analyst in a chain store that sales technological furnitures and office furnitures all over US: SuperStore. One day, the country manager tells me that he needs a complete dashboard to monitor the performance of the sales department. He wants to understand where the business is making profit and where it is not. Which states have good results ? And eventually, which city is in trouble? What are the best sellers? Which client segment generates the most profit?

An executive sales dashboard is built using a public database for a SuperStore in US. Here, I have built the dashboard upon the factors: sales, profit, profit ratio, profit per order, sales per customer, quantity and discount.I have also showcased the demographically interactive dashboard to gain deeper insights.
